    <h1 class="us">Here are some statistics about wastage of food in India</h1>
    <div class="report">
        <h3 class="repo">Did you know that about 40 % of the food produced in India is wasted?
            Despite adequate food production, the UN has reported that about 190 million Indians remain undernourished.
            It is further estimated that the
            value of food wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per annum.
            These are some bleak statistics, but they should help us realise the magnitude of the problem of food waste,
            as much as inequity, in India.
            The world recognises that no truly sustainable and developed country can exist without tackling the issue of
            food waste, and while the challenge
            in front of us may be monumental, some steps need to be taken sooner than others.</h3>
